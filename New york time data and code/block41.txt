Comcast made an offer for the Fox assets that was 16 percent higher on a per-share basis than the deal Fox struck with Disney. Mr. Murdoch’s camp ultimately decided that a transaction with Comcast “carried a qualitatively higher level of regulatory risk, including the possibility of an outright prohibition, than such a transaction with Disney,” according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Since then, Comcast has moved to complicate Fox’s plan to sell the bulk of its businesses to Disney.As part of that deal, Disney would buy Fox’s 39 percent stake in the British Broadcaster Sky. Late last month Comcast formally unveiled a $30.7 billion takeover bid for Sky, which Fox had bid $16 billion for the 61 percent it does not already own. Comcast’s bid caused the British broadcaster to withdraw its recommendation for the Fox deal.Robert Iger, Disney’s chief executive, has described Sky as Fox’s “crown jewel,” and has left Fox with few good options: Revise the terms with Disney to exclude Sky or enter into a bidding war.Now Fox may soon have another option.On Dec. 17, 2017, the price of bitcoin hit a high of $19,511. That capped a remarkable 10-month run for the cryptocurrency, which traded below $1,150 on Feb. 22, 2017.Since mid-December, the price of bitcoin has retreated. It bottomed out below $6,000 in early February and is currently down more 50 percent from its high.What triggered the tumble? Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco blame it on the CME Group’s decision to list bitcoin futures, which allowed investors to bet against the price of bitcoin rising. Bitcoin futures began trading on the CME on Dec. 17, 2017, the same day its price peaked.The researchers write:Shares of Apple have risen nearly 16 percent, including a 1.9 percent gain on Monday, the past six sessions. That rally has pushed the iPhone maker’s market value back above $900 billion and just $80 billion shy of $1 trillion.By Bloomberg’s calculations, Apple’s shares need to climb another 8.6 percent to $203.48 to reach that milestone, a first for a company listed on an American exchange.Apple’s shares had stumbled late last month as investors grew increasingly concerned that sales of iPhone’s would disappoint. But revenue from the iPhone proved stronger than feared, and the company announced a $100 billion buyback plan.News that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway had increased its stake in the company by $12.5 billion in the first quarter added to the gains.Apple’s recent run has pushed its market value well above that of its next two biggest rivals in the race to become the first $1 trillion company. According to Bloomberg, Amazon is $222 billion away from $1 trillion, while Google parent Alphabet is $264 billion shy.Elliott Management offered on Monday to buy Athenahealth for $160 a share, or $6.5 billion.The offer was made in a letter Elliott sent to the board of the health care software company. The activist hedge fund led by Paul Singer also said it may be “able to substantially improve the proposed price with additional, private diligence.”Elliot disclosed a year ago a roughly 9 percent economic interest in the company through its ownership of shares and derivatives and said that there were “numerous operational and strategic opportunities to maximize shareholder value.”In Monday’s letter, Elliott said: “Athenahealth’s potential will never be realized without the kind of operational change that the company seems unable to deliver.”Elliott said it approached Athenahealth about the company going private in November.Shares of Athenahealth rose 18 percent to $149.24 on the news.Shares of Citigroup rose 1.7 percent after the close on a WSJ report that ValueAct had built a $1.2 billion stake in the lender.Citigroup has a market value of $175 billion, so ValueAct owns about 0.7 percent of Citigroup.“The letter doesn’t call for any significant strategic changes, though it does suggest the bank could increase its plan to return cash to shareholders to about $50 billion from $40 billion,” The WSJ reports, citing ValueAct’s letter to its investors.Saturday was the day for the “Woodstock of capitalism” — Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting, and a celebration of Warren Buffett — and Andrew joined shareholders, analysts and other journalists seeking to ask the Oracle of Omaha about virtually anything.Of course, one of the big topics was succession. Mr. Buffett (half-) jokingly said that he was “semiretired,” given that Ted Weschler and Todd Combs now manage about $25 billion, while Ajit Jain and Greg Abel do more day-to-day oversight of the business. But Mr. Buffett still runs about $300 billion worth of investments. Charlie Munger, his longtime business partner, added, “Not much has changed.”Andrew has more from the meeting: Shareholders applauded a question — which they rarely do — that was critical of Berkshire’s ownership of Wells Fargo. And Mr. Buffett’s response to a gun question and a critique of Elon Musk caused lots of chatter.Some other highlights from DealBook:• Mr. Buffett is sticking with Wells Fargo despite its current troubles, and said that its current C.E.O., Tim Sloan, “is correcting mistakes made by other people.”• He loves Apple — but wants the company, of which Berkshire owns about 5 percent, to keep buying back shares. He had less-kind words for cryptocurrencies, which he said will “come to bad endings.”• He defended business with the gun industry, reiterating, “I do not believe on imposing my political opinions on the activities of our businesses.”Why is the food giant paying billions in cash for the right to sell Starbucks products in non-Starbucks locations worldwide? Because coffee is Nestlé’s fastest-growing product line — it’s also why it bought a majority stake in Blue Bottle last year — and buying the royalties to Starbucks products will supercharge its efforts.There’s another possible reason, according to Corinne Gretler of Bloomberg:The federal raid and investigation into President Trump’s fixer has cast a spotlight on Mr. Cohen’s side businesses.
